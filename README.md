==============

Kernel source code for the Drobo5N

Obtained from [here](http://support.drobo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/434).

## How to compile modules

First make sure that you have a [working cross-compiling VM](https://github.com/droboports/droboports.github.io/wiki/Setting-up-a-VM).

Log in the VM, pick a temporary folder (e.g., `~/build`), and then do:

```
git clone https://github.com/droboports/kernel-drobo5n.git
cd kernel-drobo5n
source crosscompile.sh
cd kernel
make mrproper ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=${HOST}-
cp ../config .config
make menuconfig ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=${HOST}-
```

Pick the modules from the menu, and then:

```
make modules ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=${HOST}- CFLAGS_MODULE="-DMODULE -mlong-calls"
find . -name "*.ko"
```

See the [releases](https://github.com/droboports/kernel-drobo5n/releases) page for pre-compiled modules.
